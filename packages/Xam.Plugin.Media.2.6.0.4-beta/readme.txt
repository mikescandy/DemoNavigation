## Additional Setup

## Android 
In  your BaseActivity or MainActivity (for Xamarin.Forms) add this code:

public override void OnRequestPermissionsResult(int requestCode, string[] permissions, Permission[] grantResults)
{
    PermissionsImplementation.Current.OnRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults);
}

The `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`, `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permissions are required, but the library will automatically add this for you. Additionally, if your users are running Marshmallow the Plugin will automatically prompt them for runtime permissions.

Additionally, the following has been added for you:
[assembly: UsesFeature("android.hardware.camera", Required = false)]
[assembly: UsesFeature("android.hardware.camera.autofocus", Required = false)]


### iOS

Your app is required to have keys for NSCameraUsageDescription and NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription in order to access the device's camera and photo library. The string that you provide for each of these keys will be displayed to the user when they are prompted to provide permission to access these device features.

### Windows Phone 8/8.1 Silverlight

You must set the `IC_CAP_ISV_CAMERA` permission.

WP 8/8.1 Silverlight only supports photo, not video.

### Windows Phone 8.1 RT
Set `Webcam` permission.

In your App.xaml.cs you MUST place the following code inside of the `OnLaunched` method:

```csharp
protected override void OnActivated(IActivatedEventArgs args)
{

    Plugin.Media.MediaImplementation.OnFilesPicked(args);

    base.OnActivated(args);
}
```



### Windows Store:
Set `Webcam` permission.
